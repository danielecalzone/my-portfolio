# My Portfolio

This project is a single-page portfolio showcasing my work and skills. It's built using React with Vite as the build tool, and it utilizes various libraries and tools for UI components, form management, validation, and more.

## Libraries Used

### Chakra UI
Chakra UI is a popular library for building accessible and customizable React components. It provides a set of UI components that are designed to work seamlessly together.

### Formik and Yup
Formik is used for form management and validation in this project. It simplifies the process of building forms in React and integrates seamlessly with Yup for schema validation.

### Vite
Vite is a fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development server and optimized production builds. It's used here to power the development environment and build process for the React project.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `yarn install`.
4. Start the development server with `yarn dev`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different sections:

1. **Header**: Contains external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page.
2. **Landing Section**: Displays an avatar picture, a greeting, and a brief role description.
3. **Projects Section**: Showcases featured projects as cards in a grid fashion.
4. **Contact Me Section**: Includes a form for visitors to contact the owner of the portfolio.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn dev`: Starts the development server.
- `yarn build`: Builds the project for production.
- `yarn lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
- `yarn preview`: Previews the production build locally.
- `yarn test`: Runs tests using Jest.

## Responsive Design and Testing

The portfolio is designed to be fully responsive, adapting gracefully to various screen sizes and devices. Jest tests, along with React Testing Library, have been implemented to verify the functionality and responsiveness of the components. These tests cover rendering components without crashing, verifying the presence of specific elements, testing user interactions such as form submissions and navigation, and validating the responsiveness of components by simulating different viewport sizes and screen orientations.

Additionally, ESLint and Prettier have been used for maintaining code quality and consistency. ESLint helps identify and fix problems in JavaScript code, while Prettier ensures consistent code formatting across the project.

By combining responsive design practices with comprehensive testing and code quality tools, the portfolio aims to deliver a consistent and engaging experience to users regardless of the device they are using, ultimately enhancing usability and accessibility.
